# A binary gap within a positive integer N is any maximal sequence of consecutive zeros that is surrounded by ones at both ends
# in the binary representation of N.

# For example, number 9 has binary representation 1001 and contains a binary gap of length 2. 
# The number 529 has binary representation 1000010001 and contains two binary gaps: one of length 4 and one of length 3. 
# The number 20 has binary representation 10100 and contains one binary gap of length 1. 
# The number 15 has binary representation 1111 and has no binary gaps. 
# The number 32 has binary representation 100000 and has no binary gaps.

# Write a function:

# def solution(N)

# that, given a positive integer N, returns the length of its longest binary gap. 
# The function should return 0 if N doesn't contain a binary gap.

# For example, given N = 1041 the function should return 5, because N has binary representation 10000010001 and so its longest binary gap
# is of length 5. Given N = 32 the function should return 0, because N has binary representation '100000' and thus no binary gaps.

# Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

# N is an integer within the range [1..2,147,483,647].
